Task: Read Prediction

For the read prediction task, I framed the problem as a binary classification (read = 1, not read = 0).
- I constructed positive pairs directly from the ratings data and generated negative pairs by sampling user-book combinations not present in the ratings.  
- To balance the dataset, I sampled an equal number of negative pairs.  
- I engineered features such as the number of books read by a user, the number of ratings a book received, and the average rating of a book.  
- Categorical features (userID, bookID) were mapped to indices and one-hot encoded, while numeric features were scaled and passed to the pipeline.  
- I experimented with Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers (SVM also, but it was super slow and irresponsive).
- The final pipeline used Random Forest with preprocessing, trained on the full dataset.  
- Predictions were generated for the pairs in file "pairs_Read.csv" and written to file "predictions_Read.csv".

Task: Category Prediction

For the category prediction task, I approached it as a text classification problem.  
- Training and test data were loaded from JSON files.
- Firstly, I studied the distribution of different classes (genre/categories) in the dataset and mapped their IDs to classes.
- Review text was preprocessed: lowercased, punctuation removed, stopwords removed, stemming applied, and lemmatization performed.  
- Additional features were engineered: normalized user ratings (scaled per user) and log-transformed vote counts.
- Text features were vectorized using TF-IDF, and combined with numeric features into a single feature matrix.  
- I trained a Logistic Regression classifier with L2 regularization and tuned parameters for stability.  
- The model predicted one of five categories (Children’s, Comics/Graphic Novels, Fantasy, Mystery/Thriller, Romance).  
- Predictions were written to file "predictions_Category.csv" in the required format.

Task: Rating Prediction

For the rating prediction task, I used a matrix factorization approach with bias terms.  
- First, I read the training data (file: train_Interactions.csv.gz) and mapped each userID and bookID to integer indices.  
- I initialized user and item biases, as well as latent factor matrices for users and books.  
- Training was done using stochastic gradient descent, updating biases and latent factors after each rating.  
- I included early stopping based on validation mean squared error to avoid overfitting.  
- A small hyperparameter grid search was performed (latent dimension k, learning rate, regularization) to select the best parameters. 
  (I tested on multiple combinations of latent dimension [1-10], learning rate [0.001 - 0.05] and regularization [0.02 - 0.1].
  Ultimately, I found out the best combination was k=1, lr=0.01, reg=0.05)
- For prediction, I combined the global mean rating, user bias, item bias, and the dot product of user and item latent vectors.  
- If a user or book was unseen in training, I defaulted to the global mean and zero vectors.  
- Predictions were clipped to the valid rating range [0, 5].  
- Final predictions were written to file "predictions_Rating.csv" in the required format.
