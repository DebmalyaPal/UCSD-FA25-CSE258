#### HOMEWORK-1  

The code is in `hw1_stub.ipynb`.  
The runner `hw1_runner.ipynb` can be used to run the code present in the stub.  
Before proceeding with the runner, export the stub file as a Python file (name of Python file: `homework1.py`).

###### Way 1: Using Jupyter Notebook Interface  

1. Open `hw1_stub.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Go to **File** -> **Download as** -> **Python (.py)**.  
3. Rename the downloaded file to `homework1.py`.  

###### Way 2: Using Terminal (Note: Working Directory)  
Run the following command in your terminal:  
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script hw1_stub.ipynb --output homework1
```

#### HOMEWORK-2

The code is in `hw2_stub.ipynb`.
The runner `hw2_runner.ipynb` can be used to run the code present in the stub.  
Before proceeding with the runner, export the stub file as a Python file (name of Python file: `homework2.py`).

###### Way 1: Using Jupyter Notebook Interface  

1. Open `hw2_stub.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Go to **File** -> **Download as** -> **Python (.py)**.  
3. Rename the downloaded file to `homework2.py`.  

###### Way 2: Using Terminal (Note: Working Directory)  
Run the following command in your terminal:  
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script hw2_stub.ipynb --output homework2
```

#### HOMEWORK-3

The code is in `hw3_stub.ipynb`.
The runner `hw3_runner.ipynb` can be used to run the code present in the stub.  
Before proceeding with the runner, export the stub file as a Python file (name of Python file: `homework3.py`).

###### Way 1: Using Jupyter Notebook Interface  

1. Open `hw3_stub.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Go to **File** -> **Download as** -> **Python (.py)**.  
3. Rename the downloaded file to `homework3.py`.  

###### Way 2: Using Terminal (Note: Working Directory)  
Run the following command in your terminal:  
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script hw3_stub.ipynb --output homework3
```

#### ASSIGNMENT-1
This assignment consisted of 3 tasks and python code for the same can be found under Assignment-01 directory in `assignment1.py` file.  
This file is the final version of the program that was submitted, initial work was done in notebook / colab - starting from data exploration and pre-processing to model evaluations.  
Once the script is run, the predicted values for the evaluation dataset will be stored in stored in csv files under `../Datasets/assignment1/` directory.
