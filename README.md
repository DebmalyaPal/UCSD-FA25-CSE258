#### HOMEWORK-1  

The code is in `hw1_stub.ipynb`.  
The runner `hw1_runner.ipynb` can be used to run the code present in the stub.  
Before proceeding with the runner, export the stub file as a Python file (name of Python file: `homework1.py`).

###### Way 1: Using Jupyter Notebook Interface  

1. Open `hw1_stub.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Go to **File** -> **Download as** -> **Python (.py)**.  
3. Rename the downloaded file to `homework1.py`.  

###### Way 2: Using Terminal (Note: Working Directory)  
Run the following command in your terminal:  
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script hw1_stub.ipynb --output homework1
```
